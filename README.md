Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) stages in HIV-infected patients using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. By achieving 94% accuracy, this model aids in early detection and timely interventions for better patient outcomes.

Features

Predict CKD stages using patient health data.

Optimized SVM algorithm for high accuracy.

User-friendly interface for doctors to input patient data and view results.

Visual insights into disease distribution.

Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Flask/Django

Dataset: 401 records with 25 features (e.g., blood pressure, hemoglobin).

System Workflow

1. Data Collection: Gather patient health parameters.

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.

3. Model Training: Train the SVM model to classify CKD stages.

4. Prediction: Use the trained model to make stage predictions.
